  I implemented the SDP time-dependent random ray in OpenMC, which already has
  an existing random ray solver.

  Unfortunately,  my implementation seems to be numerically unstable as well as
  incorrect. The solution begins to blow up after one timestep, even on a simple 
  pincell geometry.

  Two possibilities
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Implementation errors
      \item Numerical instability inherent to the method OR to my approach to
          the implementation
  \end{itemize}
